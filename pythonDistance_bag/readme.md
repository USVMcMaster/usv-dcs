### Complete python code to detect distance from a bag file but the issue is it has to be in a bag profile

##Regarding missing file error, you need to have those two files in the script directory
## MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel and MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt also the bag file (which is the video you take from realsense - viewer)
## A basic search of these files can get you these files otherwise let me know

###For now I am going to try writting a C script that will detect distance of the object because there is countless examples using C
